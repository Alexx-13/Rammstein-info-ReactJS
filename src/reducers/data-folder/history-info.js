      titleA : "The history of Rammstein band",
      textA : "Rammstein was founded by guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe. In 1989, he escaped to West Berlin and started the band Orgasm Death Gimmicks. At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially Kiss. After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin, where Till Lindemann worked as a basket-weaver, played drums in the band First Arsch. At this time, Richard lived with Oliver Riedel, of the band The Inchtabokatables, and Christoph <Doom> Schneider (of Die Firma). Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him; He envisioned something that would combine machines and the sound of heavy guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he talked Lindemann into joining Rammstein. Richard first discovered Till when he overheard him singing while he was working. A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive the opportunity to record a four-track demo audiotape in a professional studio. Kruspe, Schneider, Riedel and Lindemann entered and won the contest, which caught the attention of Paul H. Landers, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein then attempted to recruit Christian <Flake> Lorenz, who used to play with Landers in Feeling B. At first Lorenz was hesitant, but eventually agreed to join the band.",
      titleB : "HERZELEID (1995-1997)",
      textB : "Rammstein began to record their first studio album entitled Herzeleid in March 1995 with producer Jacob Hellner. They released their first single Du riechst so gut on 17 August and later released the album on 24 September 1995. Later that same year, they toured with Clawfinger in Warsaw and Prague. Rammstein headlined a tour of their own through Germany from 2 December to 22 December consisting of 17 shows which helped to boost the band's popularity. They then went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single entitled Seemann on 8 January 1996. On 27 March, Rammstein performed on MTV's Hanging Out in London; their first performance in the UK. Rammstein's first major boost in popularity outside Germany came when music director Trent Reznor chose two Rammstein songs, Heirate mich and Rammstein, for David Lynch's film Lost Highway. The soundtrack for the film was released in the US in the fall of 1996 and later throughout Europe in April 1997. Rammstein then went on to tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland from September to October 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 September called <100 years of Rammstein>. Guests to the concert included Moby, Bobo and The Berlin Session Orchestra, Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show.",

      titleG : "LIEBE IST FÜR ALLE DA (2007-PRESENT)",
      textG : "The band took a time out in 2006, and began work again in 2007. In an interview with German rapper Bushido (who contributed the <Electro Ghetto remix> of Amerika) on 21 January 2007, Bushido reported recording a song with Rammstein, called Vergiss uns nicht (<Don't forget us>). In this interview, Bushido also mentioned that he was unsure whether it would be on their <best of> album or not. This was the first mention of a <best of> album, or the new album all together. In addition, keyboardist Christian <Flake> Lorenz confirmed this in an interview with Metal Hammer Germany in November, stating that they would have most likely released a new album in 2008. The band did not tour during 2007 due to album production. Their website confirmed work on a new album, but no word of a <best of> album has yet been mentioned. In January 2008, guitarist Richard Kruspe confirmed on the Talking Metal Podcast that Rammstein was recording an album as they spoke, during that same interview he confirmed a <big world tour> following the next album to contain US dates. On 4 November, the band finished the pre-production in Berlin and went to the Henson Studio in Los Angeles. After 7 intensive weeks they had recorded the drums, guitars and most of the vocals. Two very short (less than two minutes) <making of> videos have been released during the development of the album. One video, released on the band's website, shows drummer Christoph <Doom> Schneider recording drums for one of the tracks (Mehr), and the second, released on the band's MySpace page, features keyboardist Flake Lorenz practicing notes for another track. On 6 May 2009, Rammstein announced a European Tour dates on their website. The June '09 release of Metal Hammer featured an interview with Rammstein-manager Emanuel Fialik. In regard to the upcoming album Fialik quoted Musically, it has the force of Mutter while the beauty of the melodies of Sehnsucht - Just so it has fixed in my ears. and also that it will feature two soft ballads and the rest will be hard as a rock. He even went as far to say that the disk is the biggest surprise since the birth of his son. The interview concluded with Fialik stating It is musically the best Album, which until now has Rammstein recorded! In July 2009, the track Liebe ist für alle da leaked onto the internet, along with promotional materials. This has led Universal Music to take action against certain fan sites. It was confirmed in August 2009 that the new album will have 11 tracks, and mixing of the album - which was taking place in Stockholm - has been completed. On September 2009, it was confirmed on the band's website that Pussy will be the first single from the new album. On the same day, The Gauntlet posted a promotional video for it. The video also confirmed the new album title, Liebe ist für alle da. Later, the title was confirmed again in an interview with Paul Landers for RockOne magazine.
