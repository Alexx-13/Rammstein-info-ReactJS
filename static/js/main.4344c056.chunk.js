son of poet Werner Lindemann and journalist Brigitte Hildegard Lindemann, who worked for Norddeutscher Rundfunk from 1992 until her retirement in 2002. His parents first met at a conference in Bitterfeld in 1959. He grew up in Wendisch-Rambow alongside his younger sister, Saskia. At age 11, he went to a sports school at the Empor Rostock Sport Club, and attended a boarding school from 1977 to 1980. His parents lived separately for career reasons after 1975, and divorced when Lindemann was still young.He lived with his father for a short time, but the relationship was unhealthy; in the book Mike Oldfield im Schaukelstuhl, his father wrote about his own problems with alcoholism and the difficulties of being a father to a teenage Lindemann. In 1978, Lindemann participated in the European Junior Swimming Championships in Florence, finishing 11th in the 1500 m freestyle and 7th in the 400 m freestyle. He was shortlisted to go to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, but left the sport due to an injury.He later worked as an apprentice carpenter, a gallery technician, a peat cutter, and a basket weaver.",imageA:"https://wallsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Till-Lindemann-High-Quality-Wallpapers.jpg",additinalInfo:"Lindemann started to play drums for First Arsch: a play on words perhaps meant to distract the authorities. It was a Schwerin-based punk band. They made an album titled Saddle Up. Till Lindemann also played one song with a German punk band called Feeling B. A song called Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend (<Song of the restless youth>) is credited on the album called Hea Hoa Hoa Hea Hea Hoa (1990) saying Till, Paul H. Landers and Christian <Flake> Lorenz all played on the song Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend. Feeling B was the former band of Paul H. Landers and Christian <Flake> Lorenz. Later in the 1990s, Lindemann began to write lyrics, possibly based on phrases and words from poems that he was beginning to write. He says he <used to drum in a punk band that consisted of bass and drums. We used to work with guest-guitarists, usually Paul and Richard. We did a short tour where I changed instruments with the bassist in the encore, that was such a success, that Richard insisted on starting a project in which I would sing. Other people joined the band but only when I left Schwerin for Berlin did it take serious form.> In 1994, they entered and won a contest in Berlin that allowed them to record a four track demo professionally. Lindemann moved to Berlin. Paul H. Landers formally joined the band, followed by the last member to join, Christian <Flake> Lorenz. Subsequently, in November 2002 Lindemann's own project, the poetry book Messer, was published. It consists of 54 poems compiled by Gert Hof, who is author of the book Rammstein and has been the band's pyrodesigner for the last seven years.

His parents divorced when he was 12. His mother remarried on american, but he did not get along with his stepfather. They moved to the village of Weisen when he was young. As a child, Kruspe was a fan of Kiss. According to him, <KISS represented capitalism in its purest sense, and every child was KISS-infected because they were so big. Kids wrote KISS on their notebooks, and if the teachers saw it, they could get kicked out of school just for having it written on their books.> When he was twelve, he had a KISS poster in his room, but his stepfather tore it down and destroyed it, and Kruspe stayed up all night putting it back together.

In 1989, he escaped from East Germany via the border between Austria and Hungary. He went to West Berlin and started a band in 1991, Orgasm Death Gimmicks. At that time, he was very influenced by American music. After the wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin, where Till Lindemann worked as a basket weaver and played drums in the band First Arsch. At this time, Kruspe lived with Oliver <Ollie> Riedel (of the band The Inchtabokatables) and Christoph <Doom> Schneider (of Die Firma). Richard realized that the music he had previously made was not right for him. He envisioned something with machines and hard guitars together. The three started working together on a new project. Kruspe soon found it hard to write music and lyrics at the same time. He got Till to join them as he had often heard him singing while working. A contest for new bands was announced and the prize was studio time. The four of them recorded the first Rammstein demo and won. Paul H. Landers knew them all and wanted to know what they were doing. After listening, he agreed to join. At this point, all they needed for the machine-sound was a keyboarder. They tried to get Christian <Flake> Lorenz to join, as he had played with Paul before in the band Feeling B. Flake was not entirely thrilled with the idea at first and didn't want to join for a long time. But, he eventually agreed. About the time the band was formed, they all had relationship problems which provided the foundation for their debut album, Herzeleid (Heartache), in 1995. Since then, they have reached gold and platinum status for their music and have become Germany's number one music export."},{id:3,firstName:"Paul",lastName:"Landers",dateOfBirth:"09.12.1964",placeOfBirth:"Berlin",image:"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/04/f1/52/04f152fd1b9bd6500523d06bbaa8f03d.jpg",generalInformation:"His father is a German man born in Czechoslovakia who taught Slavish languages. His mother is Polish and taught Russian in College. As a child, Paul had health problems and had to start a cure at 6. His nurses even nicknamed him <Kundi> (which can be translated into <regular patient>). At school he was a dreamy-looking boy with large rings under his eyes, not very keen on washing, which often led his teachers to tell him off. When he was 9 his family moved to Moscow where they stayed for one year. It's then that he spent his worst vacation ever, near the Sea of Azov - it used to be part of the USSR, now it is located in the Ukraine. Apart from those holidays, Paul really enjoyed his life in the USSR, even considered Moscow as his home for a little while, and still likes Russia very much. Around 12 or 13 Paul was encouraged to learn the piano like his sister and his parents sent him to private lessons. But very early he gave up the piano for the clarinet. He remembers his clarinet teacher very well mainly because he's the man who taught him how to\u2026take a shower! Paul then started to play the guitar without real dedication \u2013 his father had a guitar and taught him only one song, <Wer kann die Lieder der Freiheit verbieten>.

Eventually, he agreed to join, and the group began work their first album, Herzeleid (Heartache). In the band's performances and videos, Flake is often cast as the outsider of the group, possibly due to his relatively unusual presence as a keyboard player in a heavy metal group. This varies from playing the part of a scientific genius, aloof from the rest of the group, to playing a gimp role, to being left alone at the end of the <Keine Lust> video, and being bullied by the rest of the band, particularly Lindemann. These distinctive roles in the band's theatrical presentation have led to him becoming a very popular member of the group among fans.

Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him; He envisioned something that would combine machines and the sound of heavy guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he talked Lindemann into joining Rammstein. Richard first discovered Till when he overheard him singing while he was working. A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive the opportunity to record a four-track demo audiotape in a professional studio. Kruspe, Schneider, Riedel and Lindemann entered and won the contest, which caught the attention of Paul H. Landers, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo.
